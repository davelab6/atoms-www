========

A re-implementation of the Atoms Amiga game by Tom Kuhn using web technologies.

Atoms was originally a game for the Atari ST and a version was later released
for the Amiga which was given away on an Amiga Format coverdisk. This web-based
version of Atoms is based (loosely) on the design of the Amiga version of the
game.

Install & run

Gameplay
--------
Each player in turn places an atom in a cell on the board. They can either
place it in an empty cell, or any cell with their own colour atoms in it. If
the placed atom causes the cell to be overloaded, the cell will explode with
the atoms moving out into all orthogonally adjacent cells, turning any existing
atoms in those cells into the player's colour. Chain reactions can occur after
the initial explosion, which can cause sweeping changes across the board.

The maximum number of atoms a cell can hold before becoming overloaded is:
* Corners: 1
* Sides: 2
* Others: 3

Once a player's last atom has been wiped out, they are out of the game. The
winner is the last surviving player.
