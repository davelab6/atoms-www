========

A re-implementation of the Atoms Amiga game by Tom Kuhn using web technologies.

Atoms was originally a game for the Atari ST and a version was later released
for the Amiga which was given away on an Amiga Format coverdisk. This web-based
version of Atoms is based (loosely) on the design of the Amiga version of the
game.
